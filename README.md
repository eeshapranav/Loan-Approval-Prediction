Loan Approval Prediction:
This project predicts loan approval using machine learning classifiers in Python. The workflow includes data preprocessing, encoding, visualization, and classification.

Project Overview:
The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling.
Data Visualization: Visualizing categorical columns and correlations using Seaborn.
Model Training: Using K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression to classify loan approval status.
Evaluation: Accuracy scores are calculated for both training and test sets.

Tech Stack:
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

Usage:
Install required libraries.
Load the dataset and execute each cell to preprocess, visualize, train, and evaluate models.
